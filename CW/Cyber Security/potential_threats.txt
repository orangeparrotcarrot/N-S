- cryptography
	- substitution cyphers
	- symmetric key vs asymmetric key
	- public keys
	- block ciphers (symmetric key, used for files) aes/ des - jess file?
	- ecb modes
	- hashes, can't be reversed: sha-256 and sha-512 are the most secure
	- precomputed hashes using rainbow tables
	- salt passwords so same passwords have different hashes
	- passwords stored in /etc/shadow
- OS
	- access control - subjects are people. objects are files
	- user permissions: resource type, user rules, group rules, other rules
	- setuid bit: users run exe with permissions of exe's owner
	- sticky bit: prevents users w w/exe permission from deleting directory contained files
	- link vulnerabilities: add new path to an inode
